Welcome to my little corner of GitHub! 🚀 As a newbie iOS developer, I'm on an exciting journey to explore the world of app development, one line of code at a time. 📱

But that's not all there is to me! When I'm not debugging or designing user interfaces, you'll find me diving into the fascinating realms of physiology and nutrition. 🧬 I'm passionate about understanding how our bodies work and how the food we eat affects us.
